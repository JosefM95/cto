  "DESCRIPTION-FIRST-PARAGRAPH": "The number converter can convert an integer from one numeral system to another numeral system. Four numeric systems are available: decimal system, binary system, octal system and hexadecimal system.",
  "DESCRIPTION-SECOND-PARAGRAPH": "If you enter a suitable number in the text field of a numeral system, the number - converted - appears immediately in the other text fields. If you change a number, all fields are immediately recalculated.",
  "DESCRIPTION-THIRD-PARAGRAPH": "You can also display the binary number in two's complement. The two's complement is a representation of negative Integer numbers in the dual system, which does not need additional characters like + and -. Here you can set the number of bits used to display the binary number.",

  "BACKGROUND-FIRST-PARAGRAPH": "A numeral system is a system for representing numbers. The representation format is not necessarily fixed, many numeral systems are realized in a payment script or payment words. A number is generated according to syntactic rules as a sequence of numerals, also called numbers are shown.",
