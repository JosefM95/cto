                One of the oldest of cipher types was the simple substitution or monoalphabetic substitution ciphers in which each letter of the alphabet is replaced by another letter. Each plaintext letter is substituted by a unique ciphertext letter. The earliest known example is the Atbash cipher which is found in the Old Testament and dates from around 600-500BC. It uses the Hebrew alphabet where the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet is replaced by the last letter, the 2nd letter is replaced by the 2nd to last letter and so on. Using the English alphabet the Atbash substitution is:</p>
            <div class="indent">
                <p>Atbash cipher</p>
            </div>
            <pre>
	Plaintext:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
	Ciphertext: ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA
</pre>
            <p>
                Another example is the Caesar cipher which was used by the Roman general and statesman Julius Caesar (100 BC-44 BC) to exchange messages with Marcus Tullius Cicero (106 BC-43 BC) and others. In this type each plaintext letter was replaced by the letter standing three places further along in the alphabet. So plaintext letter A is replaced by ciphertext letter D, B is replaced by E and so on. The full substitution is:</p>
            <div class="indent">
                <p>Caesar cipher</p>
            </div>
            <pre>
	Plaintext:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
	Ciphertext: DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC
</pre>
            <p>
                Later versions of the substitution cipher used a keyword to create a keyed alphabet which can be used for the plaintext alphabet, the ciphertext alphabet or both. Where word divisions are kept the American Cryptogram Association (ACA) refers to the monoalphabet substitution cipher as the "Aristocrat" cipher. Another type of cipher, the Patristocrat, uses the same method of encryption but normal word divisions are not retained. An additional "rule" used by the ACA is that no plaintext letter can be substituted by the same ciphertext letter so the keyed alphabets can be shifted to avoid this. Four types of substitution are used depending on how the keyed alphabet is used and these are known in the ACA as keyword types K1, K2, K3 and K4.</p><br/>
